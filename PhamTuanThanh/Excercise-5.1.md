# (a) Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.
# (b) Does T2 necessarily satisfy C1? Explain.
# (c) If P contains a fault, and T2 reveals the fault, T1 does not necessarily also reveal the fault. Explain.

Answer Key:
A:Yes T1 necessarily satisfy C2 as This follows directly from 
the definition of subsumption.

B:No T2 doesnt necessarily satisfy C1 as There is no reason to 
expect test requirements generated by C1 to be satisfied by T2.

C:No testers believe that test sets for strong criteria are as important as they are.
As test sets for weaker criteria, they're good at detecting flaws. there is
There's no need for T2 to be a subset of T1. As a result,
It's possible that T2 will include a test that reveals the flaw.
T1 does not expose any flaws.
