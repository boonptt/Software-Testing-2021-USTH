# Return to the example at the beginning of the chapter of the two characteristics “File F sorted ascending” and “File F sorted descending.” Each characteristic has two blocks. Give test case values for all four combinations of these two characteristics.

```
We have four possibilities. Of course, many values could be used. We give simple strings
using commas to indicate line returns.
TT : apple
TF : apple, banana
FT : banana, apple
FF : banana, apple, fruit
```
