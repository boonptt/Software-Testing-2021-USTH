#  1.1 What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizerâ€™s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

## Level 2 to level 3:
The aim of Level 2 testing is to display failures. As a result, the reasoning that leads to Level 3 testing begins with the realization that testing will reveal the existence of failures but not their absence. This allows us to know that the fact which is every time we use tech, we are putting ourselves at risk and we accept that.
## Level 3 to level 4:
 Level 4 testing is defined like a mental discipline that increases quality.There are many ways to improve efficiency, one of which is to create tests that cause the program to fail.
Level 4 testing means that the aim of the test is to enhance the developers' ability to create high-quality applications.
