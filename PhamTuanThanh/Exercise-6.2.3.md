# Write down all 16 tests to satisfy the Multiple Base Choice Coverage (MBCC) for the second categorization of triang()’s inputs.*
```
We choose both '1' and '2' base choices for side 1.
Then we have 2 base tests: (1, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 2).
There will be 16 different tests:

[ (1, 2, 2)  (1, 1, 2)   (1, 0, 2)   (1, −1, 2) 
  (1, 2, 1)  (1, 2, 0)   (1, 2, −1)  (2, 2, 2)
  (0, 2, 2)  (−1, 2, 2)  (2, 1, 2)   (2, 0, 2)
  (2, −1, 2)  (2, 2, 1)  (2, 2, 0)   (2, 2, −1) ]
```
