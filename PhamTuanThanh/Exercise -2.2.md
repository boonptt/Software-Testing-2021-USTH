##If you do, or have, worked for a software development
company, how much effort did your testing / QA team put into
each of the four test activities? (test design, automation,
execution, evaluation)
I haven't been worked for a software development
company so that i don't have any experience but i think the four test activities which is test design, automation,excution and evaluation are important to effort in testing.
